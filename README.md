### Mitt Legekontor

Simple remake of my doctor's office website into app. I wanted to create an app that allows the user to easily, and with as few steps as possible, do what is needed - book an appointment, renew prescriptions and get in touch with their doctor. As simple as that.

Learning objectives:
- [ ] UIKit
- [ ] Storyboard
- [ ] Firebase

*Work in progress

Front page                 |  Book Apointment
